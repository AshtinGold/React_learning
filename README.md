# Stack Learning
Here are my notes I took during my coding learning journey.

My stack is mainly to do with Computer Vision and Robotics. However, as I move towards software, there will be some full-stack tools gradually added to the list.    

The actual stack comprises:
- PyTorch
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Gazebo
- git
- bash
- Jupyter notebook (i.e., notebook magic)
- Python
- C++
- C
- React
- Javascript
- R
- AWS
